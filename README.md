# Bank Loan Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to extract key insights into loan approvals, borrower risk, default rates, and repayment behavior. The analysis was conducted using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization, incorporating DAX functions to generate dynamic KPIs and trend analysis.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze loan performance, borrower risk factors, and repayment trends to derive meaningful insights.
- Identify high-risk borrowers by evaluating debt-to-income ratio, employment length, and loan purpose.
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize loan approval patterns, default rates, and total funded amounts.
- Utilize SQL queries for structured data analysis and DAX functions for advanced calculations to enhance reporting accuracy.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MS SQL Server) – Data extraction, transformation, and trend analysis.
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation for data visualization.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for KPI calculations, time intelligence, and advanced data modeling.
- Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling for structured reporting.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
- A higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratio significantly correlates with increased default rates.
- Debt consolidation loans exhibited better repayment performance compared to small business loans.
- Borrowers with shorter employment histories showed a higher likelihood of defaulting on loans.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be leveraged to analyze financial data effectively, extract meaningful business insights, and create data-driven visualizations that support decision-making processes.
